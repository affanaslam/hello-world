Symbolic C++
How to run the code:
Make sure compiler knows where the headers for Symbolic are: For e.g. (C:\Project\Symbolic\headers)
Compile the code using C++ compilers and run the .exe file generated. A new window will prompt and ask you for a number and a name of the file. The Number is the Power of the Power series and the File name is just the Name of the PDF that will be generated.
When the code stops execution, it would have created a PDF at the directory of the Code File named as the input name. 
Entering Higher power may result in undesirable results because SymbolicC++ crashes at very high powers.

Also attached is the header file.
